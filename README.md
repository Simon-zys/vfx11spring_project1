# [Digital Visual Effects 2011 Spring](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cyy/courses/vfx/11spring/ "Digital Visual Effects 2011 Spring") @ CSIE.NTU.EDU.TW

## Objective of the project

This project is my testing plan of examining the power and possibility of Open source for an university course, [VFX](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cyy/courses/vfx/11spring/overview/ "Digital Visual Effects 2011 Spring"), lectured by Prof. [Yung-Yu Chuang](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cyy/ "Yung-Yu Chuang 莊永裕"). The project contains 4 sub-folders, each for an assignment. Some is a programming assignment while others might focus on visual effects demo. This project will host my working history of assignments and hopefully, there is something informative or helpful to myself and others :)

## Introduction to the course

> With the help of digital technology, visual effects have been widely used in film production lately. For example, up to April 2004, the top ten all-time best selling movies are so-called "effects movies." Six of them even won Academic awards for their visual effects. This course will cover the techniques from computer graphics, computer vision and image processing with practical or potential usages in making visual effects.
